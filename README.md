# Brief overview
This project contains 3 virtual machines: a machine that runs Windows Server, one that runs Windows Client and the last one running Ubuntu. <br/>
Each VM has been uploaded to OneDrive, since they are large files that cannot be directly uploaded to GitHub. You can access the folder that contains the VMs [here](https://1drv.ms/f/s!AiJja_jxQJ8ggcEzTFktyAXqb-zKIA?e=uXwwhq).<br/>


# How to run
To run these virtual machines, you will need a virtualization program, such as VirtualBox, which you can find [here](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads). Once you have installed and configured the app, go to *File -> Import appliance* and select the *.ova file* you would like to import.
