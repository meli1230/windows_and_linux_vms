# Brief overview
This project contains 3 virtual machines: a machine that runs Windows Server, one that runs Windows Client and the last one running Ubuntu. <br/>
Each VM has been uploaded to OneDrive, since they are large files that cannot be directly uploaded to GitHub. You can access the folder that contains the VMs [here](https://1drv.ms/f/s!AiJja_jxQJ8ggcEzTFktyAXqb-zKIA?e=uXwwhq).<br/>
