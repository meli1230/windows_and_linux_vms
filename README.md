## Brief overview
This project contains 3 virtual machines: a machine that runs Windows Server, one that runs Windows Client and the last one running Ubuntu. <br/>
Each VM has been uploaded to OneDrive, since they are large files that cannot be directly uploaded to GitHub. You can access the folder that contains the VMs [here](https://1drv.ms/f/s!AiJja_jxQJ8ggcEzTFktyAXqb-zKIA?e=uXwwhq).<br/>


## How to run
To run these virtual machines, you will need a virtualization program, such as VirtualBox, which you can find [here](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads). Once you have installed and configured the app, go to *File -> Import appliance* and select the *.ova file* you would like to import. Once it finished importing, you may select the VM that you would like to run and then press *start*.<br/><br/>

When running, if your mouse or keyboard get captured, you may release it by pressing the key that is specified in the right bottom corner of the window. Usually, the key you need to press is *right ctrl*.<br/><br/>

Moreover, if you want to press *ctrl+alt+del* within your VM, you must do to from the ribbon, by clicking on *Input -> insert ctrl*alt*del*. If you simply press that on the keyboard, the action will be performed by the physical machine and not by the virtual one.<br/><br/>

In order to login on any of the users on the VMs, check the *credentials.md* file to learn the usernme and passwords that you need.

## Functionalities
The functionalities are presented in the *windows.md* and *ubuntu.md* files.
